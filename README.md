# üöÄ Automated Ticketing System (API + Workflow Automation)

## üìå Overview
This project automates the **support ticketing process** using **Trello API, Python, and Zapier**. It allows support teams to:
- üìå **Log new tickets into Trello automatically** from a CSV or API.
- üìå **Send Slack/email notifications** when new tickets are created.
- üìå **Update ticket statuses** automatically when resolved.

---

## üîß Tech Stack
- **Python** (`requests`, `pandas`) ‚Üí API calls & CSV handling
- **Trello API** ‚Üí Ticket management
- **Zapier (Optional)** ‚Üí Automates Slack/email notifications
- **Postman (Optional)** ‚Üí For API testing

---

## üìå Setup Instructions

1. **Install Required Software**
   - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - [Download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
   - [Download VS Code (Optional)](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

2. **Install Required Python Libraries**  
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas

### üìå Step 3: Get Trello API Credentials

To connect this project with Trello, you need an **API Key, Token, and List ID**.

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Get Your Trello API Key & Token**
1. **Sign up for Trello** ‚Üí [Trello Signup](https://trello.com/)
2. **Get Your API Key** ‚Üí [Trello API Keys](https://trello.com/app-key)  
   - Copy your **API Key** and save it.
3. **Get Your Trello Token**  
   - On the same API page, click **"Generate a Token"**.
   - Approve the request and copy your **Token**.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Get Your Trello List ID**
Trello organizes data as **Boards ‚Üí Lists ‚Üí Cards**. You need the **List ID** where new tickets will be stored.

1. **Create a Trello Board** (e.g., `"Support Tickets"`).
2. **Create a List** inside the board (e.g., `"Open Tickets"`).
3. **Find Your List ID** by using this API request in your browser:

4. - Replace `YOUR_BOARD_ID` with your **Trello Board ID**.
- Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_TOKEN` with your actual credentials.
- The **response will show multiple lists** with their corresponding IDs.
- Copy the `"id"` value for the `"Open Tickets"` list.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Save Your Credentials for Later**
Once you have:
- **API Key**
- **Token**
- **List ID**

You‚Äôll need to **replace these in your Python scripts** for the automation to work.

‚úÖ **Now you‚Äôre ready to integrate Trello with Python!**

### üìå Step 4: Create a Sample Ticketing System (CSV)

To simulate a help desk ticketing system, we‚Äôll use a **CSV file** to store incoming support tickets before they are logged into Trello. This file will act as a **mock database**, making it easy to test our automation.

Create a file named **`sample_ticket_data.csv`** inside your project folder and add the following content:

```csv
ticket_id,title,description,status
1,Login Issue,User unable to log in,Open
2,Network Down,Building automation system offline,Open
3,API Error,OptigoVN API failing to authenticate,Open

### üìå Step 4: Create a Sample Ticketing System (CSV)

To simulate a help desk ticketing system, we‚Äôll use a **CSV file** to store incoming support tickets before they are logged into Trello. This file will act as a **mock database**, making it easy to test our automation.

Create a file named **`sample_ticket_data.csv`** inside your project folder and add the following content:

```csv
ticket_id,title,description,status
1,Login Issue,User unable to log in,Open
2,Network Down,Building automation system offline,Open
3,API Error,OptigoVN API failing to authenticate,Open
```
This CSV file contains four columns:

ticket_id ‚Üí Unique identifier for each ticket.
title ‚Üí Short summary of the issue.
description ‚Üí Detailed explanation of the problem.
status ‚Üí The current ticket status (Open, Resolved, etc.).
This CSV file will allow us to:

Store sample support tickets before integrating with an actual ticketing system.
Process and update tickets automatically using Python and Trello API.
Easily expand functionality by adding more fields if needed.
‚úÖ Now, your project has a dataset that can be used to automate ticket processing!

### üìå Step 5: Create a Python Script to Log Tickets in Trello

Now that we have our sample support tickets stored in a CSV file, we will create a Python script to **read the tickets and send them to Trello automatically** using the Trello API.

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Python File**
1. In your project folder, create a new file named **`trello_integration.py`**.
2. Copy and paste the following Python script into the file:

   ```python
   import requests
   import pandas as pd

   # Trello API Credentials
   API_KEY = "YOUR_TRELLO_API_KEY"
   TOKEN = "YOUR_TRELLO_TOKEN"
   LIST_ID = "YOUR_TRELLO_LIST_ID"
   TRELLO_URL = "https://api.trello.com/1/cards"

   # Load tickets from CSV
   df = pd.read_csv("sample_ticket_data.csv")

   def create_trello_ticket(title, description):
       params = {
           "key": API_KEY,
           "token": TOKEN,
           "idList": LIST_ID,
           "name": title,
           "desc": description
       }
       response = requests.post(TRELLO_URL, params=params)
       if response.status_code == 200:
           print("‚úÖ Ticket added to Trello:", response.json()["shortUrl"])
       else:
           print("‚ùå Error:", response.json())

   # Loop through all Open tickets
   for _, row in df[df["status"] == "Open"].iterrows():
       create_trello_ticket(row["title"], row["description"])
‚úÖ Now, all open tickets from the CSV file will be automatically added to Trello!

### üìå Step 6: Automate Ticket Notifications with Zapier

Now that tickets are being logged in Trello, we will use **Zapier** to send automatic **Slack or Email notifications** whenever a new ticket is created.

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Sign Up for Zapier**
1. Go to **[Zapier Signup](https://zapier.com/)** and create a free account.
2. Click **"Create Zap"** to begin setting up an automation.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Zapier Automation**
- **Trigger:**  
  1. Select **Trello** as the trigger app.  
  2. Choose **"New Card in List"** as the event.  
  3. Connect your Trello account.  
  4. Select your **Trello Board** and **List** (e.g., `"Open Tickets"`).  
  5. Click **Continue** and test the trigger to pull sample data.

- **Action:**  
  1. Choose your preferred notification method:
     - **Slack:** Select `"Send Channel Message"`.
     - **Email:** Select `"Send Outbound Email"`.
  2. Connect your Slack or Email account.
  3. Customize the message:
     ```
     üöÄ New Support Ticket Created!
     üîπ Title: {{Card Name}}
     üîπ Description: {{Card Description}}
     üîπ View Ticket: {{Card URL}}
     ```
  4. Click **Test & Continue**.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Activate the Zap**
- Click **"Turn on Zap"** to activate the automation.
- Now, every time a new ticket is created in Trello, **Zapier will send an instant Slack or Email notification**.

‚úÖ **Your support team is now automatically alerted whenever a new ticket is added!**
